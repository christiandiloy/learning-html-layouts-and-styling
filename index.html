    <h1>A Softcover Book Report</h1>
    <h2>Moby-Dick (or, The Whale)</h2>
    <p>The <a href="https://www.softcover.io/">Softcover</a> publishing platform was designed mainly for ebooks like some popular IT textbooks but it's also good for making more traditional books, such as the novel <em>Moby-Dick</em> by Herman Melville (sometimes written as <em>Moby Dick</em>) We present below a short and affectionately irreverent book report on this classic of American literature.
